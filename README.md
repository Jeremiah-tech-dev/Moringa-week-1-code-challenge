# 🚀 Moringa Week 1 Code Challenge

## 📌 Description
This repository contains solutions to the **Week 1 JavaScript challenges** at Moringa.  
The projects are simple web-based toy problems that practice core JavaScript concepts:

1. **Student Grade Generator** → Calculates student grades based on marks.  
2. **Speed Detector** → Detects overspeeding and assigns demerit points.  
3. **Net Salary Calculator** → Computes gross salary, deductions (PAYE, SHIF, NSSF), and net salary.

Each project includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a functional and interactive UI.
